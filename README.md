# ML-for-Stroke-Prediction
A machine learning project for predicting stroke risk using supervised learning models. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation with Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) pipelines. The project also addresses class imbalance using SMOTE and evaluates model performance.
